## Project Overview

This project [provide a more detailed description of the project's goals and scope].

## Folder Structure

The project follows the principles of Onion Architecture, with the following folder structure:

- **Application**: Application services and CQRS commands/handlers.
- **Domain**: Domain models and business logic.
- **Infrastructure**: Database connections, external services, and data persistence layer.
- **Presentation**: API controllers and Swagger configuration.

## Persistence Layer

The persistence layer includes database interactions and concrete service implementations:

- **ProductRepository**: Handles database operations related to products.
- **OrderRepository**: Manages database operations for orders.
- **UserRepository**: Implements database operations for user-related data.

## Product

Create Product: Endpoint to create a new product.

Update Product: Endpoint to update an existing product.

Search Product: Endpoint to search for products based on a search term.

Create Product Image: Endpoint to upload and associate images with a product.

Delete Product Image: Endpoint to delete an image associated with a product.

Get Product by Id: Endpoint to retrieve details of a product by its unique identifier.

Change Showcase Image for Product: Endpoint to set a specific image as the showcase image for a product.

## Basket

Add Product to User Basket: Endpoint to add a product to a user's basket.

Update Product in User Basket: Endpoint to update a product quantity in the user's basket.

Complete User Basket: Endpoint to finalize the selection and prepare for order.

## Order 

User Order: Endpoint for a user to place an order.

Admin Complete Order: Endpoint for an admin to mark an order as completed.

Admin Delete Order: Endpoint for an admin to delete an order.

## Login


User Login: Endpoint for users to log in using credentials.

Google Login: Endpoint for users to log in using Google authentication.

Facbook Login: Endpoint for users to log in using Facbook authentication.

Reset Password via Email: Endpoint to initiate a password reset process via email.

Reset JWT Token: Endpoint to regenerate a new JWT token after expiration.

## Register

User Register: Endpoint for user registration.
Google Register: Endpoint for user registration using Google authentication.
FabebookLogin :  Endpoint for user registration using Facebook authentication.


## Validation and Filters

### Validation Filters

Validation filters are implemented using FluentValidation for robust input validation:

- **CreateProductValidator**: Validates `CreateProductCommandRequest` before processing, enforcing rules for product name, description, stock, and price.

### Action Filters

Action filters, such as `ValidationFilter`, intercept requests before execution to ensure data validity:

- **ValidationFilter**: Checks `ModelState.IsValid` before action execution. If invalid, it returns a `BadRequestObjectResult` with detailed validation errors.
